In the sea of street racing titles like Need For Speed and the simulation racers like GranTurismo and Forza, its quite rare to get a racing game which is radically different. Blur, the arcade racer with power ups and fast paced racing, is one that sticks to recent memory. Even that genre is saturated, with games like Burnout competing head to head with Blur. A view from the top has rarely been explored outside of games like highway racers on ancient game consoles and modern phone apps. Real World Racing explores that very same idea, but puts its own twist to it. Using satellite imagery of major cities of the world, such as London, New York, Tokyo and many more, Real World Racing takes its title pretty seriously, with all the racing action placed on actual routes across real world cities. It makes for some pretty slick and realistic maps, and the view from the top is certainly an unique angle. The driving dynamics are mostly arcade, but has hints of simulation blended in, wherein you're forced to brake in almost every corner, and keep in mind the need for following a racing line. The viewing angle makes things a bit difficult, since the two modes (rotating versus fixed map views) either make the map see-saw or the car swerve all over the place. It takes some getting used to, but its fun when you get the hang of it. The cars are unlicensed but they all look 90% similar to actual production cars, and the performance of the cars correspond to the real world versions of these “fakes”. You get access to fake versions of everything from the Merc A-class to the Lancer Evo, to the Porsche 918 Spyder, with almost instantly recognizable shapes. Its all about the fun, less about the details. Makes it more of a mobile game than a full-fledged PC game, but we aren't complaining
