Quite simply put, Knightfall is about the final years of the mysterious medieval order known as the Knights Templars.  Who were the Templars? Formed in the early 12th century, shortly after Jerusalem had been captured during the First Crusade, the initial purpose of the Templars was to protect European Christian travellers on their way to sites in the Holy Land. What began as a group of nine knights known as The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, over the course of the next two hundred years the Templars would grow to become the largest, wealthiest and most powerful military organisation of its time. These warrior monks lived by a strict code; they had to be celibate, own no valuables and keep very little money on them. They lived an austere life, one not attractive to everybody, but yet their numbers swelled into the thousands as new recruits came eagerly. Any money earned by the Templars went to the organisation to help build castles, new routes to the Holy Land and to give to the poor. So whilst the individual warriors were poor, the Order was very wealthy. Whilst their strict code kept them disciplined, their military training helped to carve them into fearsome warriors. Through their commitment, training and refusal to retreat, the Templars became the most feared fighting force of all the crusaders
