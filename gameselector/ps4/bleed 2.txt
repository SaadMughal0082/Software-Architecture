In the game, the player takes control of Wryn, a girl who hopes to become the "ultimate video game hero" by defeating all of the current heroes.[5] With the player's help, she takes the heroes down one by one, culminating up to the greatest hero of all time, the Giant Dragon. As soon as the Dragon is killed, a crowd of reporters shows up to bring light to the one who vanquished all the heroes. However, before Wryn gets a chance to inform them of her deeds, the unnamed blonde guy from the game's opening cutscene arrives and takes all the credit, claiming he killed the heroes. He is then taken to the Hall of Heroes to be inducted as the newest hero, leaving Wryn confused and angry. This plan backfires, though, as the blonde guy becomes universally hated across the world since no one wanted a new hero to begin with. Also, Wryn breaks into the Hall of Heroes to stop the induction. The blonde guy puts up a good fight but is beaten by Wryn, who then becomes adored by everyone for committing an act of true heroism.
